# Popo CLI Project

Accountability should be the centerpiece of any fruitful discussion on police reform. This Ruby Gem, inspired by the countless Black lives lost to police brutality, aims to shift power into the hands of citizens and place the burden of accountability on law enforcement. The Popo Gem provides a CLI to look-up officers in the Chicago and New York City police departments (departments with the [highest rates](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/cities) of police shootings) via the [OpenOversight](https://openoversight.com/) searchable database.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'popo'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install popo

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
